            <p>Warangal (pronunciationⓘ) is a city in the Indian state of Telangana and the district headquarters of Warangal district. It is the second largest city in Telangana with a population of 704,570 per 2011 Census of India,[3][4] and spreading
                over an 406 km2 (157 sq mi).[1] Warangal served as the capital of the Kakatiya dynasty which was established in 1163. The monuments left by the Kakatiyas include fortresses, lakes, temples and stone gateways which, in the present, helped
                the city to become a popular tourist attraction. The Kakatiya Kala Thoranam was included in the emblem of Telangana by the state government and Warangal is also touted as the cultural capital of Telangana.[5]</p>

        <p>The Thousand Pillar Temple or Rudreswara Swamy Temple[1] is a historical Hindu temple located in the town of Hanamakonda, Telangana State, India.[2] It is dedicated to Lord Shiva, Vishnu and Surya. Thousand Pillar Temple, along with Warangal Fort,
            Kakatiya Kala Thoranam and Ramappa Temple are added to the tentative list of World Heritage sites recognised by UNESCO. Many Hindu temples were developed under the patronage of Ganapati Deva, Rudrama Devi and Prataparudra who were of Kakatiya
            dynasty. The Thousand Pillar Temple was believed to be constructed during the period between 1175–1324 CE by order of the king, Rudra Deva. It stands out to be a masterpiece and achieved major heights in terms of architectural skills by the
            ancient Kakatiya Vishwakarma Sthapathis (Architect). The Executive officer of the subject temple is P.Venugopal.[4] It was desecrated by the Tughlaq dynasty during their invasion of the Deccan.[citation needed] However, the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad,(Mir
            Osman Ali Khan) donated a grant of 1 Lakh INR towards the reconstruction of this temple

        <h2>Badrakali Temple</h2>
        <p>The temple is believed to be built in 625 A.D by the King Pulakeshin II of Chalukya dynasty to commemorate his victory over Vengi region of Andhra Desham, as per the writings on the temple wall. Kakatiya kings later have adopted the temple and
            considered Goddess Bhadrakali as their kuladevata. A lake was also built by Ganapati-deva adjacent to the temple. Due to the fall of Kakatiya dynasty to the Muslim rulers of Delhi, the temple lost its prominence. The Kakatiyas negotiated a
            truce with Allauddin Khilji by offering the diamond in exchange not to be invaded. He sent his slave and personal confidant Malik Kufur to personally transport the diamond. In 1950, the temple was renovated by Sri Ganesh Rao Sastri a devi
            upasaka along with Gujrati businessman Shri Maganlal Sameja. After that the help of a local public and other affluent locals.[2] Apara Ekadashi is observed as Goddess Bhadrakali Ekadashi.[3] The history of the Koh-i-Noor diamond; part of British
            Crown Jewels, is closely associated with this temple as it was installed, as the left eye of Goddess Bhadrakali by the Kakatiya dynasty.[</p>
