        <p>These waterfalls are in the dense forests inhabited by the Gonds. Kunta in Gondi and Telugu means pond. Kuntalu means several ponds. The waterfall originates from a confluence of several ponds that lead to the river Kadem.[3] Formed by the Kadam
            River, Kuntala falls cascades down through two steps and can be seen as two separate adjacent falls after the peak rains. It is one of the famous one day outings from Hyderabad. There is a motorable road until the entry point of the falls,
            from where steps are available to reach the bottom of the falls. The falls are about 10 minutes (one way) walk from the entry point</p>
